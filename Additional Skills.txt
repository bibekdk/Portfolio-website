I have strong skills in UI/UX design, Microsoft Excel, photo editing, and effective communication. Along with problem-solving, time management, and teamwork abilities, these skills complement my development work and enable me to deliver high-quality, well-rounded projects. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new tools and techniques that improve both the user experience and overall project success.
