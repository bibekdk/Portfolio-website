##Full Stack Development

📚 Full Stack Development Overview
🚀 What is Full Stack Development?
Full Stack Development refers to the end-to-end development of web applications, covering both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) of a project. A Full Stack Developer is capable of working with databases, servers, system engineering, and clients — essentially handling an entire application’s development workflow.

🎨 Front-End Development
The front-end is the part of a website or application users interact with directly. It involves creating the layout, design, and interactivity of a web page using:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) — structure of the web pages.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) — styling and layout.

JavaScript — interactivity and dynamic content.

Front-End Frameworks/Libraries:

React.js

Vue.js

Angular

Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS (for styling)

🛠️ Back-End Development
The back-end is the server side of a web application, managing data and ensuring that the front-end works smoothly. It involves:

Server-side Languages:

Node.js (JavaScript runtime)

PHP

Python (with Django or Flask)

Java (Spring Boot)

Database Management:

SQL databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

NoSQL databases: MongoDB, Firebase

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

RESTful APIs

GraphQL

🔀 Full Stack Development Workflow
A typical full stack development process includes:

Designing UI/UX wireframes or mockups.

Building the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.

Developing the back-end server, APIs, and database models.

Connecting the front-end and back-end through API calls.

Deploying the application to hosting services like:

Vercel, Netlify (for front-end)

Render, Heroku, or DigitalOcean (for back-end)

Maintaining and updating the project for scalability and performance.
